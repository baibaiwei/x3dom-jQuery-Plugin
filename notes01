	note which objects you want to export: gear, heart, light01
		reserve original loc/rot/size
	
	storage options

		type : directional / point / spot
		shadow *shadowIntensity : 0 - 1 [1]
		ambience *ambientIntensity : 0 - 1 [0]
		intensity : 0 - 1 [1]
		location : x y z [curPos] 
		color : RGB / HEX [1 1 1]
		on : true / false [true]
		direction : rotation [0 0 -1] (for directional/spot only)
		radius : 1 - 100 [100] (for point/spot only)
		attenuation : x y z [1 0 0] (for point/spot only)
		width *beamWidth : 0 - pi/2 [pi/2] (for spot only)
		cutoff *cutOffAngle : 0 - pi/2 [pi/4] (spot only)
	if given the same id with light function, change given properties
	"changelight", "id"
